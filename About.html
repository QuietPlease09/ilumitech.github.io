				A smart streetlight is a public lighting fixture that incorporates technology, such as cameras, light-sensing photocells and other sensors, to introduce real-time monitoring functionalities. Also referred to as adaptive lighting or intelligent street lighting, this type of lighting system is recognized as a significant step in the development of smart cities. A system consists of LED lights, brightness sensors, motion sensors and short-distance communication networks. The lights turn on before pedestrians and vehicles come and turn off. The system integrates technologies such as: Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor, wireless network and dimmable LEDs.
